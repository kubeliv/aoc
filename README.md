# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code. I started with the 2022 calendar year,
however I started January 2nd of 2023. It's unlikely that I actually participate as new challenges
come  out, so expect these to be quite far behind! I'm mostly in it for practicing my
problem-solving skills.

As of writing, all of my solutions will be written in Kotlin, as it is currently my daily driver
programming language.
